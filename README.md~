##Ed Cai: Final Project Ideas
 
### WebVR Youtube

This idea draws inspiration from the popular VR app BigScreenVR, which allows users to use their computer VR. This doesn't seem like a super innovative or great idea at first, but the engagement metrics for BigScreenVR are incredible (more than 2 hrs/day for active users). My proposed final project of WebVR Movies is simple: create an environment where you can play Youtube Videos as a movie theatre-like experience. Some extensions of this project could be adding different environments to watch the movie, such as on a beach, on a rooftop lounge, or underwater. 

### Chatroom

This chatroom experience feels like an actual room. Building this app involves modeling a nice-ish looking room where people can enter and chat. Chatting works by typing into your keyboard. The words then appear above your avatar. Characters are able to move around by using the keyboards arrow keys. 

### 3D Cargo Bridge (Game)

For those who are not familar with Cargo Bride: [Cargo Bridge 2](http://www.silvergames.com/cargo-bridge-2) 

It is a physics-based bridge building game where the objective is to build a bridge that is cheap, but still strong enough to carry the cargo from point A to B. My proposal will be to make a similar game in VR where the objective is to create a structure that holds the most weight using a finite amount of resources.
