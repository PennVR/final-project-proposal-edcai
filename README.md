##Ed Cai: Final Project Ideas
 
### WebVR Youtube

This idea draws inspiration from the popular VR app BigScreenVR, which allows users to use their computer VR. This doesn't seem like a super innovative or great idea at first, but the engagement metrics for BigScreenVR are incredible (more than 2 hrs/day for active users). My proposed final project of WebVR Movies is simple: create an environment where you can play Youtube Videos as a movie theatre-like experience. Some extensions of this project could be adding different environments to watch the movie, such as on a beach, on a rooftop lounge, or underwater. 

### Chatroom

This chatroom experience feels like an actual room. Building this app involves modeling a nice-ish looking room where people can enter and chat. Chatting works by typing into your keyboard. The words then appear above your avatar. Characters are able to move around by using the keyboards arrow keys. 

### Photogrammetry: Top Destinations in NYC (or Philly)

Valve recently licensed software that allows you to take pictures and stitch them together into a 3D model that you can walk around VR. Normally this software costs $2500, but now you can license it for $23/month. My idea would be to use this software to create models of the top destination in NYC (or Philly) so that people could "visit" these places without having to physically be there. Normally this would not be possible with 360 degree cameras because they cannot infer depth.
